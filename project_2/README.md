# MLOps: Orchestrating Machine Learning Operations
## Overview
In this project's context, an AutoML run was executed on the [Bank Marketing](https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv) Dataset. The top-performing model obtained from the AutoML process was deployed as a RESTful API Webservice. Endpoints were utilized to interact with the deployed model in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio. Lastly, pipeline automation was employed to enhance machine learning operations.

*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
